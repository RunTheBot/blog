# Aaron Huang

I am a student at the Toronto District School Board. I am passionate about technology and I love to learn new things. I am currently learning about web development, and I am working with a new VRC team. I am also a member and former team captain of FRC Team 7520. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow!
